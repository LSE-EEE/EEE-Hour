# Explaining the (small) returns to electrification

* Why do we see such small returns to electrification? 
   * Need for complementary appliances which they do not have access to? 
* Transition equation with electrification and poverty traps
   * 2x2 matrix: does removing the poverty trap remove the result that impacts of electrification are small? 
   * How would the production functions look like for these households?
* Is electrification only valuable to people once they are wealthy enough? 
   * [Wolfram & Miguel Kenya paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235272851530035X) : people reveal that they would rather have money than have electrification 
   * Is there a threshold after which we would see large effects?
* Paradox: electrification has big returns in macro studies, but they seem muted in micro studies
   1. Selection
   2. Measurements
   3. Complementarities: transportation costs + electricity? Electricity + something else?
   4. Dynamic effects: returns to electrification do not happen in a static setting
* If we were in 1960s Korea, would we promote universal electrification? If we hadn’t, what would have the outcome been? 
   * Go back and get detailed records of where the grid went and where + secondary data on household and firms 
   * Sum up all gains going forward
   * General equilibrium effects

   * One feature: people were allowed to pay back over decades
* Is the path out of poverty broad or narrow?
   * Narrow: maybe we need electricity as a key input, without which we wouldn’t experience development
   * Broad: maybe electricity isn’t a first order requirement but is part of it
* We will provide electricity regardless but question is when is the right moment? Is it the first thing we have to do? 
* To study complementarities is extremely difficult

   * Instrument for roads, instrument for electricity, instrument for roads and electricity (for example) -- you need to instrument for the complementarity
