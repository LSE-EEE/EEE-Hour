## Gendered costs of climate change

* Gender differential responses to shocks  → gender differential responses to climate change
* Home production of goods more unsafe/difficult for women? 
  * Ground water depletion, receding forests, etc. increases time burdens 
* Gender based violence increased in contexts of greater groundwater depletion
* The role of time-saving technologies on labour force participation (e.g. Dinkelman 2011)
* Climate change makes this more difficult over time… is this reducing female labour force participation?
  * Reverse of https://www.jstor.org/stable/3700686?seq=1
* Are men migrating out in response to climate change? What does this mean for the time allocation of women e.g. do they suddenly have greater burdens? What about their kids -- are they pulled out of school?
* Is there more pressure on women to sell their assets in response to these shocks? 
* Do women specialise on tasks that are more dependent on natural resources (weather) and hence more adversely affected? 
* Would electrification help women differentially? 
  * Cooking and lighting 
* Time cost vs wage costs 
  * Responses to weather shocks may differ depending on occupations 
* Poverty traps in reverse: destroyed capital may throw you below the threshold
  * Supreet Kaur: get data from around the world (e.g. droughts) and think about big shocks that might kill capital. Can we find evidence of occupations ‘disappearing’? 
  * If a drought kills your livestock, then you should be thrown back into whatever you were doing before (e.g. wage labour? farming)
  * Gendered differences in occupations in agriculture 
* Climate mortality by gender? 
  * Barecca et al (2016) paper as a starting point but applying it to gender
  * Are women more susceptible to heat shocks?
