* Little Ice Age: period in 16-19th century as a climate shock
* Trends that emerged following this cold period
* How do you change behaviours based on your exposure to cold spells from the little ice age?
* How does downward pressure on agricultural productivity lead to (or prevent) structural change
   * Two key channels of structural change - non-homothetic preferences and differential productivity growth trends combined with non unitary elasticities of substitution. Both of these channels could be affected by this event.

* Margaret Drabble - A Writer's Britain - Book on behavioural responses to climate changes, mentions little ice age
* Climate data: how micro can we go in terms of seeing how much different areas were impacted during this period?
* [Climate history podcast](https://soundcloud.com/climatehistorypodcast)  has a few episodes about the little ice age 
* Famine during little ice age in Netherlands -- possible existing literature
