# Changing behaviours and beliefs around climate change
*Michelle Rao*

* How do policymakers learn from evidence? 
* How do we communicate what’s happening with climate change? 
* Defeatist attitude: not much we can do about it
   * What are the impacts of these attitudes? What does it mean for behavioural change?
   * How do we change these attitudes?
* Could impact micro decisions on adopting, say, energy efficient technologies or firms making large investments
* Past experiments on nudging behaviours based on climate messaging
   * Negative messaging more effective? [Link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0122-0) 
   * Other literature on media shows negative news hits and sticks more
* How do we get across what all is happening? Breaking down complexity of topic to society
* Create a country index on environmental progress to induce competition e.g. [Climate Action Tracker](https://climateactiontracker.org/) or [SDG13 tracking](https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/map/goals/SDG13)
* Is climate change an existential threat to humanity? 
   * Perhaps unlikely. Most impacts for rich countries come from migration flows.
   * How would you present ‘truth’ if the goal is to maximise some global measure of welfare
   * Perhaps people care about non-quantifiable aspects of climate change.
   * Are they really non-quantifiable? → difficult to integrate
   * Weitzman may disagree with some of this debate - [see here](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/modelinginterpretingeconomics.pdf)
   * Weitzman’ suggestion to solving the Noah’s Ark problem: [who do we save if we can’t save all?](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2999617.pdf?casa_token=xrr773tQ378AAAAA:mwIjEBbKNe6NwuXCJu0uZS4Aiz-mpmbpZX9MSTKMWvXR4Jsatp2E_xChKxqMLFjBEY59sWbowpqyQ4O7s3CXr8SFutj839zxGz8CUSPORFfO3uTjyQU) (this suggests where you should focus conservation efforts) 
* How do we portray information that is accurate but which is not excessively negatively tinged (or positively!) 
* [Nature paper discussing communication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0122-0) 
* So many diverse opinions on why people are dealing with climate change, why they care about it, why they don’t care about it, etc.
   * An area where running simple experiments is plausible or possible
* Evolution of social norms on changing behaviours for environmental reasons
   * E.g. growth of veganism
   * Does it play well in my social network? Does it allow me to signal the things I want to signal? 
* Individual actions to mitigate global externalities → individually irrational. But why do some people still choose to do it? 
   * Collective action problem vs. individual preference parameter
   * Social norms or social network? Wanting to fit in or conform to the norms
   * Being part of a group creates utility for people
   * Likewise, in a social network, even if I do not care about environment, if enough people around me do care and signal that they do then maybe I should do the same as well
   * Definitions of rationality that we are giving are not great.. what should it look like? 
   * Unravelling effects of repeated games easy to demonstrate in lab games 
   * Moving away from normative judgements about the term “rational” (i.e. rational behaviour is “good”) and just focusing on how benchmark economics models define a rational agent, lots of individual climate action is “irrational” given expected MB is super low. Understanding exactly why behaviour deviates from the “rational agent” benchmark seems useful for modelling/empirics/practice. 
* In terms of global welfare, maybe this isn’t top of the list relative to trade, innovation, etc
* Do bureaucrats have poor / outdated reference points on costs of new technologies?
   * Does providing them info / new reference points change behaviour?
   * Can you do this in an experimental setting?
