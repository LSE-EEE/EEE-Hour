* What is the ability of firms to pass these costs through?

* Location is only of the HQ of the firm, not physical plant location

* How large might the (second order) indirect effects be?

* Analysis does not weight by the sizez of linkage in the firm's network

* How much are managers thinking about climate change? For instance, is a garment manufacturer thinking about changing their input supplier due to climate change?

* Climate change is all about *expectations*. Survey firms to see if expectations on climate change are driving supplier decisions

* How does industries organise their supply chains? 

* Are firm responses in this context exacerbating the negative impacts of a weather shock?

* Does a more complex supply chain diversify risk or increase the chance that one link in the chain gets affected?

* Ongoing work by Clare Balboni: network of transactions between firms, looking at how buyer-supplier networks reconfigure following floods in Pakistan

* McMillan + Woodruff on input suppliers in Vietnam discusses what leads you to link to a particular supplier

* Establish more formality (model) on how suppliers make decisions. Quantify diversified upstream suppliers vs. undiversified upstream suppliers. Do the providiers of specliased inputs suffer less from these shocks?

* Are existing supply arrangements optimal? Certain arrangements lead to a ratcheting up of climate shocks to poor communities. In some situations you cannot have specified suppliers -- is there a policy that can help?

* Do our trade relationships lead to the developing world paying a higher cost? Examine via the trade literature
