# Discussion notes on Blakeslee et al. (2019)

* Use intensity measures of how many borewells failed in a village to get at the possible GE effects of water shortages

* Is this climate change where **everyone** gets affected? Or just a case where only **some** are affected by water shortages?

* Complementarities across climate impacts: we should factor in not just water but also temperature, for instance; useless looking at one effect in isolation

* Mapping the death of villages: census data in India shows how and where some villages just disappear

* Distortionary subsidies inhibit adaptation until it becomes too late. This avoids gradual adaptation. Do policies like NREGA trap people in poor areas for too long? 

* What are the interventions to get people to 'optimally' adapt? First, what is optimal adaptation, and second, how can we induce optimal adaptation?
