# Discussion notes on Nath (2020)

* Why are there so many farmers? Its a job many can do. Involvement in agriculture is one of the biggest constraints to adaptation

* Surplus labour: the production of farms decreases as labour leaves. Could we get experimental variation to test this? e.g. get household members to migrate or leave

* Important question: the factors the stop structural change are now important environmental problems too

* Examine macro papers which put frictions on structural transformation and then measure these frictions dynamically. For instance, work of Lorenzo Caliendo on China. Climate change = slow moving changes and rapid shocks. Uncertainy in a dynamic macro model would generate changes in contemporary decisions. 

* Increasing shift from agriculture to services. How do you get productivity growth in sevices? One advantage: services may be cleaner. Potentially a different path for Africa. 

* One barrier is that people do not exit agriculture because they cannot sell their land or assets easily (example of a friction)
